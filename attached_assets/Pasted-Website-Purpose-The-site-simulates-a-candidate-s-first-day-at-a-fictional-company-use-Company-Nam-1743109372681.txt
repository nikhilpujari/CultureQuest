Website Purpose
The site simulates a candidate’s first day at a fictional company (use '[Company Name]' as a placeholder), guiding them through workplace scenarios where their choices reflect alignment with core values like collaboration, innovation, and integrity.
Candidates will receive real-time feedback, earn points based on their decisions, and get a final ‘Cultural Alignment Score’ with personalized insights.

Website Features
Single-Page Application (SPA): Use React or vanilla JavaScript to create smooth transitions between sections (e.g., hide/show components based on progress).
Avatar Selection: A grid of clickable images; store the selected avatar in state.
Mentor Interaction: A chat-like interface where mentor messages appear as the user advances.
Scenarios: Each scenario is a component with a description and choice buttons. Show feedback immediately after a choice is made.
Scoring System: Track the score in a global state (e.g., React state or a JavaScript variable). Update it based on choices and display it in the final summary.
Final Summary: A results screen with the score, alignment level, and tailored feedback.
Design Requirements
Professional Yet Engaging: Use a modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout.
Color Scheme: Use a generic, neutral palette with accents (e.g., #4CAF50 for positive feedback, #333 for text). Optionally, allow customization for company branding later.
Fonts: Use a professional, readable font like Inter or Roboto.
Accessibility: Ensure high contrast, alt text for images, and keyboard navigation support.
Mobile-Friendly: Must work seamlessly on desktop and mobile.
Technical Requirements
Frontend: Build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use React if possible; otherwise, vanilla JS is acceptable.
State Management: Track progress, avatar choice, and score using local state.
No Backend: The experience is fully client-side with no data storage.
Deployment: Ensure the site can be hosted on a free platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
Deliverables
A fully functional SPA website with all features implemented.
Source code in a clear, commented format (e.g., separate HTML, CSS, JS files or a React project structure).
A README file with instructions to run the website and a brief overview for recruiters (e.g., 'This gamified culture fit assessment showcases my skills in JavaScript, UI/UX design, and state management').
Bonus (If Feasible)
Add a progress bar showing how many scenarios remain.
Include subtle animations (e.g., fade-in feedback or confetti for scores above 35).
Allow replaying the assessment from the final screen.
